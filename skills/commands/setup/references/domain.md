# Domain Documentation

How the skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`GLOSSARY.md`** at the repo root, or
- **`GLOSSARY-MAP.md`** at the repo root if it exists: it points at one `GLOSSARY.md` per glossary. Read each one relevant to the topic.
- **docs/adr/**:

If any of these files don't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag their absence; don't suggest creating them upfront. They can be created lazily.

## File structure

Single-domain repo:

```text
/
├── GLOSSARY.md
├── docs/adr/
│   ├── 0001-event-sourced-orders.md
│   └── 0002-postgres-for-write-model.md
└── src/
```

Multi-domain repo (presence of `GLOSSARY-MAP.md` at the root):

```text
/
├── GLOSSARY-MAP.md                 ← system-wide glossary map
├── docs/adr/
└── src/
    ├── ordering/
    │   ├── GLOSSARY.md             ← package-specific glossary
    │   └── docs/adr/
    └── billing/
        ├── GLOSSARY.md             ← package-specific glossary
        └── docs/adr/
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in an issue title, a refactor proposal, a hypothesis, a test name), use the term as defined in `GLOSSARY.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal: either you're inventing language the project doesn't use (reconsider) or there's a real gap (note it for `/domain-modeling`).

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:

> Contradicts ADR-0007 (event-sourced orders), but worth reopening because...
